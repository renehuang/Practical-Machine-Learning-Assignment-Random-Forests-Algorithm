Approach:
1.use the training set;
2.split it into training/test sets;
3.build a model on the training set;
4.evaluate on the test set;
5.repeat and average the estimated errors.

Used for:
1.picking variables to include in a model;
2.picking the type of prediction function to use;
3.picking the parameter in the prediction function;
4.comparing different predictors.

Different ways to do that:
random subsampling;
k-fold;
leave one out;

Considerations:
1.for time series data,data must be used in "chunks";
2.for k-fold cross validation:
Larger k=less bias,more variance;
Smaller k=more bias, less variance.
3.random sampling must be done without replacement;
4.random sampling with replacement is the bootstrap.(underestimates of the error;can be corrected, but it is complicated);
5.if you cross-validate to pick predictors estimate you must estimate errors.
